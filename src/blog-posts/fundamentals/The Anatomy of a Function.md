A function is the bread and butter of any program or application. While there are other pieces, the functions which make up a program are ultimately responsible for what makes a program/application "work." Functions are the engine of the program. When I was first learning how to code I was really tripped up  by a couple of things related to functions. 

The purpose of this post is to identify the things that first confused me about functions and then to shed some light on how
I've come to understand them at the moment.

## Function Invocation vs Function Definition

## Defining Parameters in a Function vs Defining Variables

## Using the Function Signature to Name Functions

## Dynamic vs Static Typing
