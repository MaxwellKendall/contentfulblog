Infrastructure as Code. Ballin.

## Configuration Object
yaml or JSON

Required Key: `resources`

Example:

``` json
{
	"resources": {
		"cat-pics": {
			"Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket"
		}
	}
}
```

The first key, `cat-pics` is considered a logical resource which creates whatâ€™s known as a _stack_. A stack is a physical resource, in this case an S3 Bucket, derived from a template.
