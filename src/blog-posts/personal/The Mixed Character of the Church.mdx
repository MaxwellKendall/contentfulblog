So let me know what you think in response to my elaboration on this point in the book. I have gone through the process of evaluating the classic Reformed position on baptism from a Baptist position and this was one of my questions as well. So I’ve given this issue a good bit of thought and regularly point this out having been convinced of this!

This parable is not the only place where Christ speaks of what I would call “the mixed nature fo the Church”. Also in Matthew 13 we see this acknowledged in the Parable of the Weeds. The character of the Church as “mixed” with believers and unbelievers speaks to our eschatology and the tension that exists in our current moment in redemptive history between the “already” and the “not yet”. We are still in the wilderness where we “already” enjoy many benefits from Christ after his incarnation, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. However, there are still benefits that are “not yet” realized; namely, our glorification and the consummation of all things with the damnation of sinners and the devil with his angels. 

So we see the definitive purification of the Church, where only the true believers reside, occurs in this parable at “the end of the harvest”. Until that time, the Church will unequivocally be mixed with both believers and unbelievers. We cannot know the heart, only God knows. As Paul says to Timothy,

> But God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”

To assume that our churches are pure with only believers is to harbor what some call “an over-realized eschatology”. We cannot totally eradicate poverty, institute and distribute perfect justice as cultural reformers, nor can we start a church with only believers. Of course we do our best in only admitting to membership those who make a credible profession of faith — with their children - but we do so confessing that our best does not result in the purification of the Church which we know will only occur by the judgment of Christ on the last day.

There is certainly more here to consider. This is an important part of our ecclesiology, and a significant difference between the Presbyterian doctrine and that of the Baptist Church.
