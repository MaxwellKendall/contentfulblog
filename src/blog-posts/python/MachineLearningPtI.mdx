# Features of a Model
This is the data associated with the `X` or `domain` of a dataset. It is typically what we already know and may be refrerred 
to as `independent variables`. They are typically, but not always, related to the output, y, or `target` of a data set.

# Targets of a Model
This is what we don't know about a dataset; the `y`, `output`, `range`, or `dependent variables` of a dataset.

# Data Structures
2D and 1D arrays are typically used to represent relational data; as in, cells within a column, within a row. We also have 
abstractions around this which give the ability to label those columns.
